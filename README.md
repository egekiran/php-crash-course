## Introduction

This project is a collection of PHP scripts demonstrating various language features. Each file focuses on a specific topic.

## Basics

- `types.php`: Introduction to PHP data types.
- `numbers.php`: Working with numbers and arithmetic operations.
- `null.php`: Handling `null` values and coalescing.
- `refs.php`: Understanding variable references.
- `expressions.php`: Basic PHP expressions.

## Control Structures

- `if.php`: Conditional logic with `if`, `else`, and `elseif`.
- `switch.php`: `switch` statements for multiple conditions.
- `match.php`: The new `match` expression (PHP 8 feature).
- `while.php`: `while` loops.
- `dowhile.php`: `do-while` loops.
- `for.php`: Standard `for` loops.
- `foreach.php`: Iterating over arrays with `foreach`.
- `foreach-ref.php`: Using references within `foreach` loops.

## Functions

The `functions/` directory contains examples of defining and using functions:

- `functions/function.php`: Basic function syntax.
- `functions/anon.php`: Anonymous functions (closures).
- `functions/arrow.php`: Arrow functions (short closures).
- `functions/byref.php`: Passing arguments by reference.
- `functions/generator.php`: Working with generators.
- `functions/higher-order.php`: Higher-order functions.
- `functions/named.php`: Named arguments.
- `functions/pure.php`: Concept of pure functions.
- `functions/recursive.php`: Recursive functions.
- `functions/types.php`: Type declarations in functions.
- `functions/varidaic.php`: Variadic functions (variable number of arguments).

Also includes:
- `scope.php`: Variable scope and visibility.
- `union.php`: Union types in function signatures.

## Strings

- `strings.php`: Basic string operations.
- `string-manipulation.php`: Modifying and transforming strings.
- `string-search.php`: Searching for substrings.
- `string-formatting.php`: Formatting strings (e.g., `printf`).
- `string-advanced.php`: More complex string handling.

## Arrays

- `arrays.php`: Creating and manipulating arrays.

## Object-Oriented Programming

The `classes/` directory covers OOP concepts:

- `classes/classes1.php`, `classes/classes3.php`, `classes/classes4.php`: Examples of classes and objects.
- `classes/enums.php`: Enumerations.
- `classes/interfaces.php`: Defining and implementing interfaces.
- `classes/traits.php`: Using traits for code reuse.

## Other

- `require/`: Examples of file inclusion using `require` and `include`.
